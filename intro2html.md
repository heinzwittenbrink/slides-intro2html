## Packages

## language-html

> Many Core and Community packages come bundled with their own snippets that are specific to it. For example, the language-html package that provides support for HTML syntax highlighting and grammar comes with dozens of snippets to create many of the various HTML tags you might want to use. If you create a new HTML file in Atom, you can type html and then press Tab and it will expand to:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

> To see all the available snippets for the file type that you currently have open, choose "Snippets: Available" in the Command Palette.

> In that welcome screen, we are introduced to probably the most important command in Atom, the Command Palette. If you press Cmd+Shift+P while focused in an editor pane, the command palette will pop up.
