# Design principles

## Content first

- Separation of content and presentation
- Descriptive markup of content
- Additional markup for machines

## Progressive enhancement

- Accessibility and future friendliness
- Universal usability of the content
- Device independence

# Basic elements for authoring text

## Block- and Inline-Elements

- [Inline elements - HTML | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements "Inline elements - HTML | MDN")
- [Block-level elements - HTML | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements "Block-level elements - HTML | MDN")
- Important: The value of the `display`-property can be changed via CSS (see [display - CSS | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display "display - CSS | MDN"))

## Headings

- Six levels from `h1` to `h6`
- Important for SEO
- Since HTML5: Outlines allow more than one `h1`-heading

## Paragraphs

```html
<p> ... </p>
```
- Fundamental for structuring text
- Should not be used for presentatiion purposes

## Lists

```html
<p>I have lived in the following countries:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Norway
 <li>Switzerland
 <li>United Kingdom
 <li>United States
 </ul>

<ol>
<p>I have lived in the following countries:</p>
 <li>Switzerland
 <li>United Kingdom
 <li>United States
 <li>Norway
 </ol>

 <dl>
 <dt> Authors
 <dd> John
 <dd> Luke
 <dt> Editor
 <dd> Frank
</dl>
```
- Three types: `ul`, `ol`, `dl`
- List items can include other blog level elements

Examples: @zotero-2358590-5495

## Tables

```html
<table>
 <caption>Characteristics with positive and negative sides</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th> Characteristic
   <th> Negative
   <th> Positive
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <th> Mood
   <td> Sad
   <td> Happy
  <tr>
   <th> Grade
   <td> Failing
   <td> Passing
</table>
```
Example: @zotero-2358590-5495


## Links


```html
<a href="https://google.com" title="Google Search">Google</a>
```
- Links are the most important html elements
- They can reference document fragments

# New Structural Elements in HTML5

## div and span

- `div` and `span` were (and are) used to structure HTML documents mainly for presentation purposes
- They serve as a base for `id` and `class`-attributes
- Their use has become obsolete by semantic HTML5 elements

## Semantic Elements in HTML5


```html
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
```

Simple Explanation: w3schools: [HTML5 Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp "HTML5 Semantic Elements")

# HTML and XML

## Alternative syntax

- HTML/HTML5 can be written in HTML and XML Syntax
- Example of a Doctype Declaration in XHTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
    "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0 plus SVG 1.1//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/2002/04/xhtml-math-svg/xhtml-math-svg.dtd">
```

# Validation

## What is validation?

> XML validation is the process of checking a document written in XML (eXtensible Markup Language) to confirm that it is both well-formed and also "valid" in that it follows a defined structure. Source: @XMLValidation2019

::: notes

HTML (and also XML) documents can be *validated*. That means: It can be automatically checked, whether a document complies with the rules for HTML. Of course validation is important for authoring HTML documents. To validate a document while you are authoring it makes it much easier to arrive at a correct&mdash;i.e. *valid*&mdash; document in the end. But this kind of validation is relevant because also software for processing HTML can validate a document. Google checks whether a document is valid and uses the results for its evaluation of the quality of a document.

To be sure that you have written *good* HTML you should always validate your documents. To do that you have to understand the messages of the validator. If you understand these messages you are always able to correct your document.

> A well-formed document follows the basic syntactic rules of XML, which are the same for all XML documents.

> A valid document also respects the rules dictated by a particular DTD or XML schema. Source: @XMLValidation2019

::: notes

These two quotes refer to XML which has stricter rules than HTML (except XHTML). We have two different levels of validity:

1. the compliance with the general rules for the language. In the XML world this is called *well-formedness*. In HTML this means for instance that the elements are correctly embedded in an hierarchical way or that end tags are written with a slacg after the pointed bracket (`</`).
2. Correct resp. required elements and attributes at a specific place. E.g.: Inside the `head` there must be a `title`; in the `body` the element `title` is forbidden.

## Why validate?

::: notes

The W3C gives a good account of the reasons to validate HTML as an autor. [@XMLValidation2019]

::: notes

The easiest tool to validate a document ist the Validation Service of the World Wide Web Consortium. You can upload a document or insert the URL.

## Browser Addons

- [Html Validator - Add-ons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/html-validator/ "Html Validator - Add-ons for Firefox")

- [Validity - Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/validity/bbicmjjbohdfglopkidebfccilipgeif?hl=en-GB "Validity - Chrome Web Store")

::: notes

There are several other tools for validating a document. Maybe the most important ones are these browser plugins.
