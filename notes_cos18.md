# Parsing

by using HTML we make a document readable for a computer in order to make it usable for humans

---

The different properties of HTML serve to make it parseable - the output is standardized and contains the information needed for further processing. By JavaScript information can be added to this output. CSS serves to present this (and only this) output. (Every textual content on the web can be formatted as HTML. )

---

> HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.
